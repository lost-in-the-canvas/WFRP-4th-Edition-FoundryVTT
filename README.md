## Modules

I've made a module out of my homebrew supplement [Arcane Marks & Careers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uTy2r0EDMdcISFqqyxeIOSadtzz-OTAg/view) which can also serve as an example for others to build off of. It includes a compendium pack of all the careers as well as tables to roll for marks. Read more and download from [here](https://github.com/moo-man/Arcane-Marks-Careers-FVTT)
